	<h2> Dr. Pandey's Teaching Philosophy </h2>
	<blockquote> <p>Education is the kindling of a flame, not the filling of a vessel.<small><em>Socrates</em></small> </p></blockquote>
	<p>
	 This statement summarizes the central idea of my teaching philosophy. Education and teaching are central to the role of university professor: not only to help individuals build a knowledge base, but to become independent navigators and contribute to a changing field throughout their lives. I strongly believe that the hallmark of a good researcher is the ability to communicate their ideas to diverse audiences, including students in university classrooms.
	</p>
	
	<p>	My teaching philosophy manifests itself in several student-centered goals and objectives. A student-centered goal prioritizes the learning of students in the classroom aligned with the overall learning objectives and wisdom of the subject matter. My teaching goals are focused on three dimensions of student learning:
	</p>
	<div class="row">  
		<div class="col-md-4"> 
			<div class="panel panel-info">
				<div class="panel-heading"><b>Dimension 1: encouraging self-directed learning</b> </div>
				<div class="panel-body">
					<ul>
						<li> <b>Focus</b>: encourage students to learn beyond the classroom environment and develop the ability to think critically </li>
						<li> Learning activities to promote this dimension:
						<ul> 
							<li> assign open-ended questions as part of pre-class reading materials </li>
							<li> point students to the latest research in the field as additional reading</li>
							<li> use online tools (like <a href="https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/" target="_blank">Seeing theory</a>) for promoting intuition behind mathematical fundamentals</li>
							<li> require students to reflect on their performance in graded assignments </li>
						</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>  
		<div class="col-md-4"> 
			<div class="panel panel-warning">
				<div class="panel-heading"><b>Dimension 2: connecting theory and practice</b> </div>
				<div class="panel-body">
					<ul>
						<li> <b>Focus</b>: enable students to think beyond theoretical realms and engage with the problems in practice</li>
						<li> Learning activities to promote this dimension:
						<ul> 
							<li> invite guest speakers from different areas of practice and industry </li>
							<li> encourage students to participate in team projects working on real-life problems</li>
							<li> point students to internship or volunteering opportunities</li>
						</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-4"> 
			<div class="panel panel-danger">
				<div class="panel-heading"><b>Dimension 3: developing interpersonal relationships</b> </div>
				<div class="panel-body">
					<ul>
						<li> <b>Focus</b>: motivate students to communicate effectively, in writing or orally, and encourage fostering a sense of respect and understanding towards other individuals within or beyond classroom walls</li>
						<li> Learning activities to promote this dimension:
						<ul> 
							<li> plan regular classroom group discussions while periodically shuffling the group composition</li>
							<li> have students deliver course-project presentations and evaluate each other through peer feedback</li>
							<li> provide rubrics for assessment of technical course project reports</li>
						</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>
	<!--<p>
		<ol> 
			<li> encouraging independence and helping students become self-directed learners, 
			<li> connecting theory and practice enabling students to think beyond theoretical realms and engage with the problems in practice, and 
			<li> developing interpersonal relationships including learning to communicate effectively, in writing or orally, and fostering a sense of respect and understanding towards other individuals within or beyond classroom walls.
		</ol>
	</p> -->
	
	The course materials that I design are aligned with these dimensions of student learning. Feel free to reach out to me if you'd like to discuss any of these in detail.
