	<h3> Teaching Philosophy </h3>
	<blockquote> <p>Education is the kindling of a flame, not the filling of a vessel.<small><em>Socrates</em></small> </p></blockquote>
	<p>
	 This statement by Socrates summarizes the central idea of my teaching philosophy. I enjoy teaching and value it primarily because it helps an individual build their knowledge base and become an independent navigator and contributor to the field. I strongly believe that the hallmark of a good researcher is the ability to communicate their ideas to diverse audiences, including students in university classrooms.
	</p>
	
	<p>	My teaching philosophy manifests itself in several student-centered goals and objectives. A student-centered goal prioritizes the learning of students in the classroom aligned with the overall learning objectives and wisdom of the subject matter. My teaching goals are focused on three dimensions of student learning: 
		<ol> 
			<li> encouraging independence and helping students become self-directed learners, 
			<li> connecting theory and practice enabling students to think beyond theoretical realms and engage with the problems in practice, and 
			<li> developing interpersonal relationships including learning to communicate effectively, in writing or orally, and fostering a sense of respect and understanding towards other individuals within or beyond classroom walls.
		</ol>
	</p>
	
	The course materials that I design are aligned with these dimensions of student learning. Feel free to reach out to me if you'd like to discuss any of these in detail.
